## 🆙 What's New In This Fork (The Receipts)

No fluff, no cap — here is everything genuinely upgraded in this fork:

- 🎤 **Live Lyrics Tab & Asynchronous Lyrics Worker** (`catalog.py`, `jobs.py`, `panel.py`): Dedicated 4th library tab with background lyrics extraction via `ytmusicapi` watch playlist endpoints, complete with source attribution and text selection.
- 🌙 **Sleep Timer with 15-Second Volume Attenuation** (`panel.py` + `player.py`): 15m, 30m, 45m, and 60m countdown presets with live badge timer and smooth exponential fade-out to zero before pausing.
- 🔀 **Upcoming Queue Shuffle & Repeat Modes** (`player.py` + `panel.py`): Non-destructive upcoming track shuffle preserving listening history, plus cycleable repeat modes (`off` ➔ `all` ➔ `one` ➔ `off`).
- ⚡ **Variable Playback Speed Control** (`player.py` + `panel.py`): Cycle between `1.0x`, `1.25x`, `1.5x`, and `0.75x` via native `QMediaPlayer.setPlaybackRate()`.
- 🪟 **Desktop Glass Opacity Tuner** (`config.py` + `settings_dialog.py` + `panel.py`): Live 60%–100% window translucency slider in preferences with instant real-time feedback and persistent storage.
- 🌊 **Fluid Spring Equalizer Bars** (`panel.py`): Upgraded from stepped integer modulo ticks to a 4-bar spring-damper physics simulation (`SpringPhysics`) with harmonic wave oscillations and anti-aliased gradient fills.
- ⚡ **Zero-Latency Thread Pool Isolation** (`player.py` + `jobs.py`): Separated stream resolution into an isolated playback thread pool so audio decoding *never* queues behind heavy radio queries or multi-image artwork downloads. Audio plays the millisecond the stream URL is resolved.
- 🛡️ **Network Resilience & Retry Backoff** (`catalog.py` + `stream.py`): Wrapped `ytmusicapi` and `yt-dlp` in exponential backoff retry loops (`_with_retry`), robust format fallback sorting (prioritizing Windows Media Foundation-friendly M4A/AAC), and automatic dead-track auto-skipping.
- 💾 **SQLite Local Library & Playback History** (`storage.py`): Persistent local database (`ember.db` in AppData via Python's built-in `sqlite3` — zero external bloat). Pin favorite tracks with one click (`♡` / `♥`) and revisit your listening history anytime in dedicated tabs.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Multi-Theme Palette Engine** (`config.py` + `theme.py`): Extended `Palette` with 5 hand-crafted presets (`Amber`, `Emerald`, `Amethyst`, `Solar`, `Rose`) without breaking the single-source-of-truth architecture. Re-skins Qt stylesheets and all custom-painted widgets live at runtime.
- 🎛️ **Preferences & Settings Panel** (`settings_dialog.py`): Dedicated modal dialog (`⚙`) for volume normalization (softens loudness spikes across tracks), endless queue toggles, runtime theme selection, glass opacity, and desktop toast preferences.
- ⌨️ **Configurable Hotkeys with Conflict Detection** (`settings_dialog.py` + `app.py`): Customize your playback chords directly in the UI, complete with real-time detection flagging conflicts with default Windows shortcuts (`Ctrl+C`, `Alt+F4`, `Win+L`, etc.).
- 🔍 **Real-Time Search Debouncing** (`panel.py`): Smart 350ms input debounce on catalogue search so you can type freely without spamming network requests or stalling the UI.
- 🍞 **Ghost "Now Playing" Desktop Toast** (`toast.py`): Subtle floating toast that slides in with album art when a track starts, completely non-intrusive and never steals window or typing focus.
- 📜 **Rotating File Logging** (`app.py`): Standardized logging levels and upgraded to `RotatingFileHandler` (2 MB, 3 backups) so logs never balloon your disk.
- 🧪 **Automated Test Suite & GitHub Actions CI** (`tests/` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Expanded to 37 comprehensive unit, resilience, and smoke tests covering models, themes, storage, lyrics jobs, queue pruning, repeat logic, spring physics, and retry resilience.

## 🚀 Get This Running (it's not that deep)

> [!NOTE]  
> **Platform Support**: Ember is built specifically for **Windows** (Python 3.10 to 3.13). It relies on Windows Media Foundation (WMF) audio pipelines, Win32 topmost API calls (`user32.SetWindowPos`), and the Windows system tray. We don't ship fake shell scripts for platforms it wasn't engineered for.

### The Fast Way (Automated)

```bat
install.bat
```
Creates an isolated `.venv` in the directory and installs pinned dependencies into it. Your system Python stays completely untouched.

```bat
launch.bat
```
Launches Ember smoothly in the background without keeping a pesky command prompt window open.

*(Want to see console logs in real time? Run `launch_debug.bat` instead.)*

### The Manual Way

```bat
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\pythonw.exe -m ember
```

## ⌨️ Default Hotkeys

| Keys | Action |
|:---|:---|
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Space` | Play / pause |
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `→` | Next track |
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `←` | Previous track (or restart song) |
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `E` | Toggle expanded panel |
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `↑` | Expand panel |
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `↓` | Collapse panel |
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F` | Focus search field |

*(All chords can be customized from the `⚙` Preferences dialog inside the player).*

## 🎨 Design System

One palette. One source of truth.

> Espresso base, amber light, cream typography — built for a dark room, glowing monitors, and a long evening.

Every visual token lives in `Palette` in `ember/config.py`. `theme.py` compiles those tokens into Qt stylesheets using `string.Template`, and every custom-painted widget (`VinylDisc`, `EqualiserBars`, `VolumeDial`, `SeekBar`, `Hairline`, `QueueRow`) reads from that exact same class.

Switch to `Emerald`, `Amethyst`, `Solar`, or `Rose` from the settings menu and the entire player repaints in real time.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Threading Architecture)

Stream resolution and recommendation generation run completely asynchronously on **isolated thread pools**:

1. **Playback Pool**: Dedicated exclusively to `LoadJob`. When you pick a track, the audio stream resolves and begins playing immediately.
2. **Background Pool**: Handles `RadioJob` (graph look-alikes), `ArtJob` (cover thumbnails), and `SearchJob`. Heavy background tasks never stall or delay audio playback.
